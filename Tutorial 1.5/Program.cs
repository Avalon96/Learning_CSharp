#Exercise
You're given a short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
Your application needs to output/display each student’s name and final score.

Currently, the teachers grade book shows the graded assignments for each student
as follows:

Sophia: 93, 87, 98, 95, 100

Nicolas: 80, 83, 82, 88, 85

Zahirah:   84, 96, 73, 85, 79

Jeong:  90, 92, 98, 100, 97

The teacher requires that the calculated grades for each student are displayed as follows:

Student     Grade
Sophia      94.6  A
Nicolas     83.6  B
Zahirah     83.4  B
Jeong       95.4  A
